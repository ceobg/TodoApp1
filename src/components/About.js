<b>GLORY</b> was founded in 2020 by Shona. 
I first moved to Paris 5 years ago
to follow my dream. I have always had a desire
to start my own business. Given the opportunity to make a 
fresh start and do something creative, I decided to 
make a career out of something that had been a hobby of 
mine for year. Beauty, makeup, business and 
connecting with people somehow I've been able
to put all my skills into a profitable 
business. This app is the beggining of something great,
beautiful and <i>gold</i>. </p>
